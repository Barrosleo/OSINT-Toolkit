# OSINT-Toolkit

## 1. Project Goal & Overview

**OSINT-Toolkit** is a GitHub repository designed as an all-in-one portfolio for OSINT investigation tools. This project serves both as:

- **An Educational Resource:**  
  It provides comprehensive guides on OSINT methodologies, descriptions of various tools and frameworks, cheat sheets, and blog-style explanations on best practices.
  
- **A Practical Tool:**  
  It aggregates Python scripts and example integrations that scrape public data sources, interface with popular OSINT tools (e.g., recon-ng, Maltego – simulated), and run automated workflows to clean and correlate data for threat assessments and investigations.

**Target Audience:**  
SOC Level 1 analysts, cybersecurity enthusiasts, and anyone looking to improve their OSINT skills.

## 2. Core Components & Functionality

**OSINT Data Scraper:**  
Developed in Python, this script (`scripts/data_scraper.py`) fetches and parses data from public sources.

**Tool Integrations:**  
Scripts such as `scripts/recon_ng_integration.py` simulate interfacing with OSINT tools (e.g., recon-ng), demonstrating how to use such tools via APIs or command-line interfaces.

**Automated Data Correlation:**  
The script `scripts/data_correlation.py` cleanses and correlates collected data, showing how to synthesize multiple data points for threat assessments.

**Documentation & Cheat Sheets:**  
Detailed documentation is provided in the `docs/` directory, including guides on OSINT tools and a cheat sheet for quick reference.

## 3. Getting Started & Installation

### Prerequisites:
- Python 3.8+  
- Git  
- (Optional) Jupyter Notebook/Lab for exploring the demo notebook

### Installation:

1. **Clone the repository:**
  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/Barrosleo/OSINT-Toolkit.git
  cd OSINT-Toolkit
  ```

2. **Create a virtual environment and install dependencies:**
  ```
  python -m venv venv
  source venv/bin/activate   # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
  pip install -r requirements.txt  # (Create this file if additional dependencies are needed)
  ```

## 4. Usage Examples

### **Running the Data Scraper:**
  ```
  python scripts/data_scraper.py --url "https://example.com"
  ```
This command scrapes data from a public source (in this demo, a placeholder URL) and prints the output.

### **Running the Data Correlation Script:**
  ```
  python scripts/data_correlation.py
  ```
This script reads sample data from examples/sample_data.json and generates a sample report.

### **Exploring the Demo Notebook:**
Launch Jupyter Notebook and open:
  ```
  jupyter notebook notebooks/OSINT_Demo.ipynb
  ```

## 5. Supporting Resources & Documentation

- **OSINT Overview & Best Practices:** See `docs/Overview.md`.

- **Tool Documentation:** Detailed information about OSINT tools and integrations is in `docs/OSINT_Tools.md`.

- **Cheat Sheet:** Quick reference on OSINT concepts is available in `docs/CheatSheet.md`.

---

## 6. Technical Considerations

- **Programming Languages:** Python

- **Frameworks/Libraries:** Standard Python libraries (e.g., requests, BeautifulSoup, json); add additional libraries as needed.

- **Data Sources:** Public websites, APIs, CSV/JSON data, etc.

- **Deployment Environment:** Local machine (Docker deployment can be added)

- **Version Control:** Git/GitHub

---

## 7. Desired Outcomes/Impact

- **Improve Analyst Efficiency:** By automating data collection and correlation.

- **Enhance OSINT Understanding:** Through detailed documentation and interactive demos.

- **Provide Hands-On Learning:** With practical scripts and a demo notebook.
