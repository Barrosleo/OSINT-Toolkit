# OSINT Tools and Integrations

This document describes the various OSINT tools integrated into this repository and how they can be used for investigations.

- **Data Scraper:**  
  The `data_scraper.py` script retrieves data from public sources using HTTP requests and parses the HTML content with BeautifulSoup (or similar libraries).

- **Recon-ng Integration:**  
  The `recon_ng_integration.py` script simulates interaction with recon-ng. In a real deployment, you might wrap recon-ng commands or use its APIs to automate OSINT tasks.

- **Data Correlation:**  
  The `data_correlation.py` script cleans and merges data collected from various sources to provide a unified threat assessment.

Each tool is documented with examples and sample outputs in the examples/ directory.
